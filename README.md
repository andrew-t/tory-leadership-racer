# Tory Leadership RACER!

![Tory Leadership RACER](res/preview.png)

A SNES-style kart-racer game based on the 2019 Tory leadership campaign by [Andrew](https://www.andrewt.net).

* Every lap, one contender is eliminated, [as per leadership campaign rules](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48395611).
* Don't drift too far right or else Jacob Rees-Mogg will glom onto you and scupper your chances.
* Don't drift too far left or you'll join Change UK and therefore be ineligible to win this (or any other) vote.

## Controls

On keyboard, A and D steer while S breaks; SHIFT is accelerate and SPACE selects a kart. Touch controls should appear on mobiles. Lastly you can also plug in an Xbox pad â€” then A accelerates and B brakes, the sticks control steering and camera (should you want that). A selects a kart.

## Build process

Copy the files onto the internet; it's a web page, why is it suddenly fashionable for them to have build processes?
